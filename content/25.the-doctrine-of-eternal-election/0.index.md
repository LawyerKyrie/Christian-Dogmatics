title: THE DOCTRINE OF ETERNAL ELECTION.
description: De Electione Aeterna sive de Praedestinatione.
---

The doctrine of eternal election has been treated by our dogmaticians at various places in their dogmatic treatises (in connection with the doctrine of divine grace, Quenstedt, Hollaz; or with that of salvation in Christ, Baier). If the doctrine of election is taught in its Scriptural truth, it does not matter at what place in a dogmatic treatise it is presented.[^1]
 
Nevertheless, since the doctrine of election is not a central article of faith, but is given, in the main, for the consolation of the believers, and since also, as the Formula of Concord observes [Epit., XI, 11](https://boc.confident.faith/ep-xi-0011){:target="_blank"}, we should proceed in the study of [God's predestination](bible God's predestination){:target="_blank" title="Google shows this result with use of this search term; bible God's predestination"} "according to the order which St. Paul has observed in the Epistle to the Romans, who first directs men to repentance, to knowledge of sins, to faith in Christ, to divine obedience, before he speaks of the mystery of the eternal election of God," we prefer to place it after the discussion of the doctrines of sin and grace, repentance and faith, so that the student may consider it with all the facts and consolatory promises of the Gospel well in mind.

[^1]: The doctrine of preservation, whish is treated in the Christian Dogmatics chapter 18, is normally treated in connection to this doctrine of eternal election or divine grace/salvation.
